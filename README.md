# Garry's Mod Trainbuild Decal Repository
A public repository for everyone's decals, real or fictional.

If your textures from the original pack are missing, it was removed due to poor texture management. If you fix the textures following the rules below, feel free to pull request them. The deleted packs can be found in .rar files in their original location.

# Rules for PRing decals
> Your image MUST be less than 4096x4096 (you seriously shouldn't need anything above 1024x1024).
> Exceptions may be made for long/wide decals, e.g. 256x4096 but this is unlikely.

> Railroad folders MUST be the railroad's reporting mark, real or fictional.

> Any new folders for fictional entities MUST be prefixed with "f_". (e.g. "f_lpsx") 

> Your VMT and VTF MUST be in the same spot and placed in the respective location (real or fictional).

> Keep it PG

# Good etiquette for textures
> Set "Normal Format" to DXT1 and "Alpha Format" to DXT5.

> Most decals don't need to be over 1024x1024.

> Your decal should to to the EDGES of the texture (as much as proportionally possible).

> If possible, trim tops/sides off texture if it's empty space, e.g. if it's wider than it is long.

> Individual letters/numbers should not exceed 512x512
